# Eventza 🎉

A full-stack event management platform connecting users with event companies and managers. Built as a **MERN stack application** to streamline event discovery, booking, and administrative oversight.

Designed and developed solely by me as a MERN Stack Developer, this project demonstrates end-to-end development skills including frontend interactivity, real-time communication, secure authentication, and backend scalability.
